This SDK provides a universal HTTP API for controlling diverse agents, such as Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Amp, within isolated sandbox environments, aiming to resolve issues related to API fragmentation and transient state management.\n\n**What's Fundamentally New**\nThe SDK introduces a universal HTTP API that abstracts the proprietary interfaces of multiple coding agents, allowing developers to integrate agents once and swap them via configuration. It functions as a server within a sandbox, enabling remote control of agents and providing necessary isolation for executing arbitrary code, differentiating it from traditional SDKs that often require local execution.\n\n**Developer Relevance**\nThis SDK is crucial for developers building robust agentic systems, as it eliminates the need to rewrite integrations for each agent runtime and addresses security concerns related to local code execution. By offering standardized APIs and secure sandbox execution, it simplifies complex agent orchestration, accelerating the development and deployment of AI-powered coding workflows.\n\n**Example Usage**\nThe SDK operates as a server inside a sandbox, exposing an HTTP API. Developers interact with this API from their applications to manage agents. For instance, to execute a command:\n```\n// Conceptual example, specific SDK methods would be used here\nconst agentClient = new RivetSandboxAgentClient(\"http://localhost:8080\");\nawait agentClient.initializeAgent(\"claude-code\");\nawait agentClient.executeCommand(\"git clone my-repo\");\nconst results = await agentClient.getExecutionResults();\n```\n(No public usage example provided.)\n\n**Impact & Implications**\nThe Rivet Sandbox Agent SDK is expected to reduce friction in integrating and adopting diverse AI coding agents into development workflows. Its consistent interface and secure execution environment promise to lead to more reliable, maintainable, and scalable agent-powered software development, allowing engineers to concentrate on higher-level logic.\n\n**Source**\n*   [PRIMARY] InfoQ: Rivet Launches the Sandbox Agent SDK to Solve Agent API Fragmentation (February 23, 2026).\n*   [SECONDARY] GitHub: rivet-dev/sandbox-agent repository.\n\n---\n\n## WaveMaker Agentic Application Generation System\n\n**Overview**\nWaveMaker has launched a new agentic application generation system, specifically designed for enterprise teams to accelerate the development of design-led, long-lived web and mobile applications. This system operates as a hybrid Integrated Developer Environment (IDE), combining agentic prompts with a visual canvas and a code editor.\n\n**What's Fundamentally New**\nThe system employs a \"two-pass code generation methodology\" that enforces an architecture-first approach to automate developer tasks using AI agents. It generates production-ready, open-standards code from inputs such as Figma design files, prompts, and APIs. This methodology aims to reduce inconsistencies and hallucinations often seen in AI-generated code while keeping developers in control of the process.\n\n**Developer Relevance**\nThis platform is highly relevant for enterprise developers aiming to leverage generative AI for faster application delivery while ensuring predictable quality and controlled costs. It streamlines the entire design-to-development workflow by converting UX designs into functional application markup, facilitating rapid prototyping and reducing manual effort for architectural integrity and design system adherence.\n\n**Example Usage**\nDevelopers feed Figma design files or natural language prompts into the hybrid IDE. The system then generates stack-agnostic application markup for UI components, layouts, API bindings, and backend services. Developers can visually validate and refine the generated applications within the Studio, utilizing seamless switching between visual, prompt, and code editor modes.\n\n**Impact & Implications**\nThis system has the potential to significantly reduce development cycles and costs for enterprise applications by automating much of the initial coding and embedding architectural best practices from the start. It enables developers to focus on core business logic and innovation, as the system handles the generation of maintainable, enterprise-grade code for frameworks like Angular, React, and React Native.\n\n**Source**\n*   [PRIMARY] GlobeNewswire: WaveMaker Fuses Design and Development with Architecture-first Agentic Application Generation System for Enterprise Dev Teams (February 19, 2026).\n*   [PRIMARY] WaveMaker Blog: WaveMaker Enters the Agentic Universe (February 18, 2026).\n*   [SECONDARY] Devdiscourse: WaveMaker Unveils Cutting-Edge Agentic Application Generation System (February 20, 2026).\n\n---\n\n## Databricks AI Gateway (Beta) (Extended Window)\n\n**Overview**\nDatabricks has released its AI Gateway in Beta, positioning it as an enterprise control plane for governing Large Language Model (LLM) endpoints and coding agents. This centralized service provides functionality to analyze usage, configure permissions, manage capacity, and log LLM traffic across various providers and models.\n\n**What's Fundamentally New**\nThe AI Gateway introduces advanced features for enterprise AI workload management, including a rich user interface, enhanced observability, and expanded API coverage. Key capabilities include rate limiting and intelligent traffic routing across multiple providers for improved reliability and load balancing. It enables organizations to seamlessly switch LLM providers and models without modifying code.\n\n**Developer Relevance**\nFor developers and platform engineers, the AI Gateway streamlines the operationalization of LLM-powered applications and coding agents. It ensures consistent governance, security, and cost management across diverse AI deployments, thereby reducing the complexity of integrating and managing multiple AI models and services. This ultimately accelerates the development of production-ready agentic systems and generative AI applications.\n\n**Example Usage**\nDevelopers can establish and configure AI Gateway endpoints for their LLMs and coding agents, then interact with these endpoints using standard APIs, such as the OpenAI client. The gateway manages the underlying routing, permissions, and logging. For example, an application can call a single AI Gateway endpoint, and the gateway intelligently routes the request to the most suitable LLM based on predefined policies.\n\n**Impact & Implications**\nThe Databricks AI Gateway serves as a critical infrastructure component for enterprises scaling their AI initiatives. It facilitates robust governance, cost control, and performance optimization for LLM and agentic workflows, boosting confidence in deploying AI applications within sensitive or high-demand environments. This platform aids in the transition from experimental AI pilots to stable, production-grade systems.\n\n**Source**\n*   [PRIMARY] Databricks on AWS: February 2026 Release Notes (February 12, 2026).\n*   [PRIMARY] Azure Databricks | Microsoft Learn: AI Gateway (Beta) (February 12, 2026, and updated Feb 20, 2026).\n*   [SECONDARY] Databricks Blog: What's New in AI/BI - February 2026 Roundup (February 11, 2026).\n\n---\n\n## DEVELOPER TAKEAWAYS\n\n\u2714 **Rivet Sandbox Agent SDK**: Investigate this SDK for unifying agentic workflows when integrating multiple coding agents, particularly for secure execution in sandbox environments and abstracting diverse agent APIs.\n\u2714 **WaveMaker Agentic Application Generation System**: Consider evaluating this platform if your enterprise requires accelerating application development with AI, emphasizing an architecture-first approach for design-led, maintainable code generation.\n\u2714 **Databricks AI Gateway (Beta)**: Assess this solution for centralized control, governance, and monitoring of LLM endpoints and AI agents, especially for scaling AI applications in an enterprise setting that demands reliability and cost management.",
